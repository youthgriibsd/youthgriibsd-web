Sometimes, we should ask ourselves, in what ways has God provide for us? We are able to live, breath, enjoy life, and it is something that is profoundly beautiful. However, why do we still feel like we do not have enough from time to time in our life? We kept yearning for more material things, more praises, but is that really what we need? Join us this week for fellowship, where we can learn to understand God's glorious ways of tending to our needs, even when we are oblivious to it. See you there.
