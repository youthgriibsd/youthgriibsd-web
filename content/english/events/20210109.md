Failure is never an easy subject to tackle. We experience it often and really, no one escapes failure and disappointment in life. However, when we turn to the Bible, we also realize that failure and disappointment are on just about every page. The question then, is that how do we plan on it, and prepare for failure so that we can still grow spiritually. Join us this week for fellowship, where we examine failure from the Bible, and prepare ourselves for it. See you there.
