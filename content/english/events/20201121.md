'Surely God is good to Israel, to those who are pure in heart. But as for me, my feet had almost slipped; I had nearly lost my foothold. For I envied the arrogant when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.' In Psalms 73, even Asaph realizes that although God is good to his people, circumstances may arise which tempt the soul to question the goodness of God. Come and join us for this week’s fellowship, where we examine our human heart and how distorted our views can be when it comes to God’s provision and goodness. See you there.
