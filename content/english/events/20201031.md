During this five-hundredth anniversary of the Reformation, it is indeed critical to ask, what was the Reformation all about? One key concern of the Reformation that is often forgotten is its revival of a reformation of the heart. Come join us for this weekâ€™s fellowship at GRII BSD or via Zoom, where we learn the biblical view of the reformation of the heart. See you there.
