In this pandemic, many of us are facing various hardships in our lives. Loss of family members, economic difficulties and other struggles are things that we, or maybe our close friends are dealing with. When dealing with these things, we can be at a very low place, and sometimes do not know where to find solace. However, if we look in the book of Deuteronomy, it says, "The LORD himself goes before you and will be with you; he will never leave you nor forsake you. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged." Join us this week for fellowship, where we can get a reassurance, understanding and hope that God is always with us, and we will never walk alone when we are with God. Let us embrace the presence of God, and walk willingly with him. See you there friends.
