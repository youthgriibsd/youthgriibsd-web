We are bound to experience failure in our lives. We sometimes overestimated our strength, fear of the disapproval of others, or sometimes do things without carefully thinking. However, according to 1 Peter 5:7, "Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you." Peter had failed, but he cast himself on the Mercy of God. Join us for fellowship, and stop carrying that burden of guilt, shame, failure. Drop it all on Him because he cares for you. See you there.
