In John 14:6, it's written that "Jesus said to him, 'I am the way, and the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.'" This is a rather bold claim, and for some of us, this either-or choice may seem too extreme. However, as we consider Jesus' words, it is also important to remember that this statement is made while Jesus is preparing to go to the cross. He is comforting his disciples in the face of his impending death, by reminding them the truth. Join us this week for fellowship, where we will revisit and understand the story, so that we can find confidence in this claim of Jesus, and the courage to follow his teachings. See you there.
