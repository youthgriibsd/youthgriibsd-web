Most of us, especially Christians, would feel that the church is our second home. After all, that is where we go to pray, and spend time with the Lord every Sundays. However, have you ever personally take the time to ruminate, whether you actually love the church? As we look at a church up close or behind the scenes, we will definitely see some messiness, because undoubtedly the church is filled with messy people. What is it that you look in a church? What makes you able to love the church, despite the imperfections? Join us this week for fellowship, where we can hopefully realize, that churches are designed to be communities of impossible love that only work if God is real, Christ's sacrifice is real. Let us learn about the reasons why we should love the church. See you there.
