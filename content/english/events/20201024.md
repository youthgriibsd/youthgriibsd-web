Technology is an ever-growing facet of our lives, yet a double-edged sword that requires cautious and intentional use. We should ask, how is our use of technology shaping the way we live and think, and what is the impact upon us as we live the Christian life? Come join us for this week's fellowship at GRII BSD or via Zoom. See you there.
