You might remember the story of the Crossing the Red Sea in the Book of Exodus, where Moses led the Israelites to escape the Egyptian army. That might seem mythical and extraordinary, but we as Christians believe that God was indeed leading Moses and the Israelites. Come join us for this week’s fellowship at GRII BSD or via Zoom, where we explore the story further, and learn about the significance of that event in our Christian life. See you there.
