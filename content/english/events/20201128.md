Many of us might know that epistemology is a branch of philosophy, but not knowing more anything about it. Some of us might know that epistemology is actually the study of the theory of knowledge, asking the questions of 'How do we know what we know'? Come and join us for this week’s fellowship, where we will learn more about epistemology, understand how the idea of knowing stands in the context of the intellectual virtues, and examine the relationship of epistemology to religious belief. See you there.
