God has made a covenant with the human race since the beginning of time. However, all of us have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. We cannot count the number of times we have been breaking the covenant that God has promised to us. Only a few that still strive to keep that covenant, and live according to his Word. Join us this week for fellowship, where we will learn how we to stay true to ourselves and to his Word, how to be someone that strive to keep promises and not break it. See you there.
